# Working with grids

There is a Frontend Mentor Challenge that I have queued up to do. I got a little burned out running on coffee and pepsi for a few days and took a day to recuperate on the couch. But ... the coding can't stop, can it? So while I have the TV blaring, I decided to work on a design in my head inspired by the Frontend Mentor Challenge "[Testimonials Grid Section](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/testimonials-grid-section-Nnw6J7Un7)". Sure it's a lot of lorem ipsum, but like I said, I am just fooling around while I half watch a series on Netflix. 

Showcasing it here because I am rather proud of what I accomplished in a couple hours.
